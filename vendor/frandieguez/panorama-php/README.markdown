Panorama PHP
============

What  is this!
--------------

With this wrapper class you can manage any video service in a uniformed and
unique way. You only need the URL from the video service you are going to use.

A quick example:

To include [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HziGOzKOb9w&feature=player_embedded) in
[a post](http://www.retrincos.info/video/2011/04/27/2011042717512600207.html) you only need to know the
url of the video. With Panorama-PHP API you get this information:

        $video = new \Panorama\Video("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQnbtldFyo")
        $video.getTitle() => "paradon del portero"
        $video.getThumbnail() => "http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GPQnbtldFyo/default.jpg"
        $video.getEmbedUrl() => "http://www.youtube.com/v/GPQnbtldFyo"
        $video.getEmbedHTML()(width, height) => "<object [...]</object>"
        $video.getFLV() => "http://...flv"
        # all together :)
        $video.getVideoDetails(width, height) => {
                                                'title' => ...,
                                                'thumbnail' => ...,
                                                'embed_url' => ...,
                                                'embed_html' => ...,
                                                'flv' => ...
                                              }


Install it!
-----------

1. Just put in one of your include_path folders, and make sure to use an
PSR-0-compatible autoloader.

Dependencies
------------
This library only depends on PHP 5.3, you have to use namespaces and some other goodies of 5.3 version.

Please __don't ask for PHP < 5.3 support__, you shouldn't use PHP 5.2.

Use it!
-------

The idea is make it as simple as possible. For a URL video like <http://vimeo.com/1785993>:

        $video = new \Panorama\Video("http://vimeo.com/1785993")

Then you have methods to know information about the video in your application.

-   __getTitle:__ A method to know the title of the video of the service.
  
          $video.getTitle()
          => "Beached"
          
-   __getService:__ A method to know the name of the video provider service.

        $video.getService()
        => "Vimeo"

-   __getThumbnail:__ An image representation of the video. Each service has a different size, but... it works :)

          $video.getThumbnail()
          => "http://bc1.vimeo.com/vimeo/thumbs/143104745_640.jpg"

-   __getEmbedUrl:__ The url (with flashvars) of the video player.

          $video.getEmbedUrl()
          => "http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1785993 [...] &show_portrait=1"

-   __getEmbedHTML(width, height):__ Uses the embed\_url to build an oembed string. The default width x height is 425 x 344, but we can specify a different one.

          $video.getEmbedHTML(400, 300)
          => "<object width='400' height='300'><param name='mo [...] 300'></embed></object>"

-   __getFLV:__ Gets the flv url. Not all the services has this option. Remember that
in some services the flv url expires and in their terms don't allow using the
flv without its player.

          $video.getFLV
          => "http://www.vimeo.com/moogaloop/play/clip:1785993/ [...] 8ee400/video.flv"

-   __getVideoDetails(width, height):__ All together :), returns all the previous elements
in a hash. Width and height can be specified to build the embed\_html.

          $video.getVideoDetails()
          => "array( [...] )"
