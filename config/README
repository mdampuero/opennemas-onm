Here there are some files to configure your ONM instance.

 - config.inc.php-dist should be renamed to config.inc.php and edited to fit your
   database configurations and some other advanced configs.

 - vhost.conf-dist should be copied to your apache configuration folder and
   edited to point to your public folder inside this ONM instance.

 - 

Have fun!
